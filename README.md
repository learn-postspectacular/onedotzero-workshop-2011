Processing/toxiclibs workshop @ onedotzero festival 2011

The exercises of this workshop are using a pre-release (BETA) version
of the upcoming toxiclibs-0021 library collection, which is bundled
with this workshop source code release.

Please remove any earlier toxiclibs install from your Processing
libraries folder and replace with this version.

As a reminder, this is how your folder structure should look like:

    <your sketchbook folder>
	  /libraries
        /toxiclibs-complete-0021/

The default location of the sketchbook folder is:

Mac: <User home>/Documents/Processing 
Win: <User home>/My Documents/Processing

Please also note that you might run into problems if you're already
using Processing 2.0 alpha... The workshop version was 1.5.1.

Happy coding! :)
